"""Live API -> one ``cyqnt.input/v1`` JSON, ready for a strategy to decide on.

``build_input_bundle`` assembles a bundle from files on disk. This is its live
sibling: it **calls the catalog nodes over the network** and lands every response
in the same envelope, so paper/live signal generation reads exactly the artifact
shape a replay does.

    bundle = build_live_bundle(symbol="BTCUSDT", interval="1h")
    #   {"schema": "cyqnt.input/v1",
    #    "decision_time": 1785415010565,
    #    "frames": {"klines":  {"shape": "BarFrame@1.0",    "status": "ok", "rows": [...]},
    #               "funding": {"shape": "MetricFrame@1.0", "status": "ok", "rows": [...]},
    #               "news":    {"shape": "EventFrame@1.0",  "status": "ok", "rows": [...]}},
    #    "source_status": {..., "open_interest": "error: CLI returned non-JSON"},
    #    "warnings": [...]}

Four things it does that a loop of ``requests.get`` calls does not:

**Normalises through the catalog.** Every response goes through the node's own
``normalize()``, so the metric vocabulary comes from one place. Hand-rolling the
long-form conversion is how the same field ended up named ``rate`` in one
artifact and ``funding_rate`` in another, with consumers silently reading
``None`` from whichever they did not expect.

**One clock, and it actually gates.** Every node is fetched inside one
``DataSession`` and every row is then dropped unless
``available_time <= decision_time``. Recording an ``as_of`` without filtering on
it — which is what the runtime did — means a replay reads rows it could not have
known.

**One time window, expressed in time.** Sources arrive at wildly different
cadences (1h bars, 8h funding, 5m open interest). Windowing them by *row count*
gives each a different span: 240 rows is 20 hours of 5-minute data and 80 days of
8-hourly data. So the window here is the bar span, in milliseconds, applied to
every frame.

**Reports what it could not read.** A node that fails appears in
``source_status`` with the reason and an empty ``rows``, never as an absent key —
"I did not read it" and "I read it and it was empty" stay different facts.
