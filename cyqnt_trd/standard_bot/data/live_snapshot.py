"""One live collection -> one ``DataSnapshot`` a block strategy can actually read.

The missing connector
---------------------
Both halves of this path already existed and were never joined:

* :func:`build_live_bundle` calls every catalog node, normalises through the
  node's own vocabulary, gates once on ``available_time``, and reports the status
  of each source — producing a ``cyqnt.input/v1`` dict.
* :func:`load_input_bundle` turns that dict back into a ``DataSnapshot``:
  ``klines`` → ``market``, ``universe`` / ``ticker_rank`` → ``universe``, and
  **every other frame → ``DataSnapshot.frames``**.

But nothing in the runtime called either one. ``assemble_snapshot`` — the builder
the paper and backtest entrypoints use — has no ``frames`` parameter at all, so
the snapshot it produces carries bars and nothing else. A strategy declaring
``needs={"derivatives": True}`` ran anyway, against price alone.

So this module is one function, and its value is entirely in being *called*::

    snapshot = build_live_snapshot(symbol="BTCUSDT", interval="1h")
    batch = plugin.run(snapshot, config)     # make_signals() sees 35 columns, not 13

Why go through the bundle instead of assembling directly
--------------------------------------------------------
The bundle is not an extra hop, it is the artifact that makes the run
reproducible. Collecting straight into a ``DataSnapshot`` would lose three
things, each of which has already caused a bug here:

* **One PIT gate, applied once.** Gating per-source mid-loop dropped every row of
  a source that was fetched 22 seconds after the session clock started.
* **``source_status`` for every declared node.** "I could not read it" and "I read
  it and it was empty" are different facts, and a strategy that abstains needs to
  know which one it is looking at.
* **Replay.** ``write_bundle=`` hands back the exact bytes; feeding them to
  ``load_input_bundle`` reproduces the decision offline, with no network.
