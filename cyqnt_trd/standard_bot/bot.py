"""``StandardBot`` — one base class, complete input in, complete output out.

The repo grew three bot shapes independently: ``BlockStrategyPlugin`` (per-bar
booleans on one instrument), ``SelectionStrategyPlugin`` (rank a universe) and
``AdvisoryBot`` (emit alerts off named frames). They already share the registry
and ``run_pipeline_step``, but each declares its inputs differently and each
returns a differently-shaped payload — so "what can this bot read?" and "what
can it tell me to do?" had three answers.

``StandardBot`` is the single answer:

**Input** — a bot declares :class:`DataRequest` entries against the data-node
catalog. The framework fetches them under one decision time, records per-node
status, and hands over a :class:`BotContext`. A bot cannot read a node it did
not declare, and a declared node that failed is visible as status rather than
absent data.

**Output** — :class:`StandardSignal`, which states the instrument, the position
intent (including **which side is being closed**), the entry, the full exit
plan, sizing, risk limits, validity, reasoning, evidence, data quality and
provenance. One shape covers trade, selection and advisory; the difference is
which intents a bot is *allowed* to emit, and that is declared, checked, and
impossible to violate by accident.
